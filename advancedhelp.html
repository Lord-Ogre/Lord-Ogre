        <h2>What determines happiness?</h2>
        <p>Happiness is determined by averaging the happiness of each ogre in your swamp. You can check the current values of these with <a href="./commands.html#Ogretype">/ogretype</a>. Other things which change your happiness include:
        <br>
        <br>-Winning a battle (determined by how much you gain +10 @ 2hours of supplies)(attacking only)
        <br>-Losing a battle (determined by how much you lose -10 @ 2hours of supplies)(defending only)
        <br>-taxrate (-taxrate/8)
        <br>-project rate (project rate * 8 / total population)
        <br>-Farmer - Miner fighting ( -15/30min at 1:1 ratio and no unemployment and swamp size > 10,000)
        <br>  
        <br>However, it's important to note that when you don't have enough onions, ore or money, you can only loose happiness.</p>
